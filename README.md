		<p>
			I'm currently employed in the web development field, where I discovered my true passion. My knowledge in front-end and back-end was acquired during my time at Trybe, where I dedicated myself to various projects involving HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and also explored libraries and frameworks like React and Express. In addition, I have experience working with SQL and NoSQL databases, as well as image manipulation using Docker.
<br><br>
In my current role, I am focused on web development using Vue and Nuxt on the front-end, Nest on the back-end, and MongoDB as the database. My next goal is to enhance my skills in mobile app development.
<br><br>
If you'd like to connect and exchange experiences in the technology field, please feel free to reach out. I'm always open to conversations and networking with fellow professionals in the industry.
